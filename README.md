# W.O.O.D

Install the requirements.txt and run Main.py

Make sure to chnage the line 

win2find = 'Puzzle Pirates - XXXXX on the Emerald ocean'

where XXXXX is your pirate name

When in game have the window on your main monitor and focused for the script to run

This codebase is unfinished and honestly kinda sucks, feel free to push request or fork etc
